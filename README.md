# Mission_to_Mars_Week_10
The goal of this was to set up a working website that scraped information from different URLs. After the data was scraped from those webpages, an html file was created to create
a website that would have assorted data on Mars. Throughout the assignment, different views of Mars' different hemispheres were scraped and added to the html file. This required
using a for loop to click through each of the full size images for the hemispheres. Once this was worked out on juypter notebook, using VScode I made sure that the for loop was
properly imported. Finally, I added two Bootstrap 3 components, one to change the color of header 2, and one to change the background color of the website.
